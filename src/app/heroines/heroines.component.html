<!-- The word uppercase in the interpolation binding, right after the pipe (|) character, activates the built-in UppercasePipe.
Pipes are a good way to format strings, currency amounts, dates and other display data. Angular ships with several built-in pipes and you can create your own. -->
<div>
  <label for="name">Hero name: </label>

  <!-- [(ngModel)] is Angular's two-way data binding syntax.
  Here it binds the hero.name property to the HTML textbox so that data can flow in both directions: From the hero.name property to the textbox and from the textbox back to the hero.name. -->
  <input id="name" [(ngModel)]="heroine.name" placeholder="name">
</div>
